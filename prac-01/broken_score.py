Fixed program to determine score status

# Check your boundary conditions (e.g. >= 50 should be a pass, not just > 50)
# Think about efficiency and nesting; use the fewest number of if/elif
# "The Zen of Python" says, "Flat is better than nested."
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
# Also note that here we only have one path for "Invalid score" (DRY principle)
# You want to make sure the last path is "else", not "elif" as we always want a result here,
# so there should be no final condition (if it wasn't one of the earlier possibilities,
# it must be the last thing, no need to check if it is)

    print("Invalid score")
elif score >= 90:

elif score >= 50:
    print("Passable")
